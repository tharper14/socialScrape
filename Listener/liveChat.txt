Liked “After those 2 the next most important things to me is going to be the data.

I want to know to easily pull up a chart of info/links or maybe it’s just meta data auto populated into Kyno or final cut, but somewhere I want to be able to easily access the following:

- who sent the video in
- link to the video
- linked videos profile @
- linked videos profile name
- date video was posted
- date video was sent in
- number of likes
- number of shares
- number of comments
- what the caption said
- list of the captions hashtags
- what the top 3 or 5 comments were and how many likes those comments had”
