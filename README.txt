1. Open VS Code, click on “Explorer” on top left pane and click open folder and find socialScrape folder (ideally throw it in your home directory > /users/tylerharper for me)
2. Open terminal within VS Code > View > Terminal
3. Navigate to socialScrape folder > cd socialScrape (change directory) —it should already be here if you opened folder properly (tylerharper@Tylers-MBP socialScrape % )
4. Make sure node is installed > “node -v” (should say v16.13.2) 
5. Look in index.js file and update directory where you want to download the files to (Line 35) (example: /Users/tylerharper/Downloads)
6. Fill out text file properly; 1 link per line, no blank lines, hit save
7. Index.js is the starting point for this script, to run script, just type “node index” in the terminal and hit enter. 

Ctrl + C will abort the loop if you want to stop it
